# Recursive-Feature-Elimination
 
In this project We implement the Recursive Feature Elimination(RFE) method to find best features in the dataset.
- Recursive Feature Elimination(RFE) is the Wrapper method
- This means that a different machine learning algorithm is given and used in the core of the method, is wrapped by RFE, and used to help select features.
- Once the feature importance has been determined, it then removes those less important features one at a time in each iteration.
